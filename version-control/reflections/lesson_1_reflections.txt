How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

Viewing a diff limited the amount of text needed for review to only what 
changed so needed to look through a lot less text to find the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

Can go back to a previous version at anytime.  Can see what code was changed 
when.
